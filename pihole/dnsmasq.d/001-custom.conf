# When replying with information from /etc/hosts or configuration or the DHCP leases file dnsmasq
# by default sets the time-to-live field to zero, meaning that the requester should not itself cache
# the information. This is the correct thing to do in almost all situations.
# This option allows a time-to-live (in seconds) to be given for these replies.
# This will reduce the load on the server at the expense of clients using stale data under some circumstances.
